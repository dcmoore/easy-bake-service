# Easy Bake Service

__Requires Clojure version of 1.4 or higher.__

The goal of this library is to abstract away the following tasks:

  * __DONE__ - normalize inputs & outputs (xml & json) - middleware
  * _under construction_ - document endpoints - lein task
  * _under construction_ - validate inputs - middleware
  * _under construction_ - generate a client - lein task
  * _under construction_ - generate a skeleton service - lein task

## Normalize Inputs & Outputs

The below code example is an example application that showcases how Easy Bake Service can normalize incoming and outgoing requests/responses. Leaving the app free of xml and json parsing concerns.

```clojure
(ns example-app.core
  (:require [compojure.core :refer [defroutes GET POST]]
            [easy-bake-service.middleware.normalize :refer [wrap-normalize]]
            [ring.adapter.jetty :refer [run-jetty]]))

(defn- xml-response [body]
  {:status 200
   :headers {"Content-Type" "application/xml"}
   :body body})

(defn- json-response [body]
  {:status 200
   :headers {"Content-Type" "application/json"}
   :body body})

(defroutes handler
  (GET "/xml" [] (xml-response [:sup {:dude "not"} "much bro"]))
  (GET "/json" [] (json-response {:sup-dude "not much bro"}))
  (POST "/echo" request (str (:body request))))

(def app
  (-> handler
      wrap-normalize))

(defn -main []
  (run-jetty app {:port 4321}))
```

Assuming your project.clj file has all the dependencies listed it needs you should be able to boot this service.

From a setup standpoint, all we have to do is require the wrap-normalize function and wrap it around our app handler.

With the server up, we should be able to run the following curl commands:

```bash
$: curl localhost:4321/json
=> {"supDude":"not much bro"}

$: curl localhost:4321/xml
=> <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><sup dude="not">much bro</sup>

$: curl -iX POST localhost:4321/echo -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"supDude":"not much bro"}'
=> {:sup-dude "not much bro"}

$: curl -iX POST localhost:4321/echo -H "Content-Type: application/xml" -d '<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><sup-dude>Not much bro</sup-dude>'
=> [:sup-dude {} "Not much bro"]
```

As you can see the wrap-normalize automatically normalizes xml and json in any casing to and from clojure data structures with idiomatic clojure casing. The wrap-normalize function knows which format (xml or json) to convert to and from based off of the specified content-type in the request and response.
